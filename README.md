# __Convolutional-Neural-Network__
This is a convolutional neural network trained with more than 10,000 dogs and cat images respectively. 
I have built this network three layers deep, giving an accuracy of 87%.

Libraries i used to build the above neural network are :
- KERAS (Using Tensorflow Backend)
- Tensorflow (For structuring the ANN)
- numpy (For numerical computations)
The above neural net is 4 layers deep and i even uploaded the weight values of my training session. I got 98% of training accuracy 
and 87% of testing accuracy.

The dataset is in my drive: __https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1XaFM8BJFligrqeQdE-_5Id0V_SubJAZe?usp=sharing__
